# Image Augmenter

Dependancies:

imgaug - https://github.com/aleju/imgaug - 

	This does all the grunt work of augmenting the images, my script makes use of this in a nice way to make it scalable in order to autonomously augment lots of images in multiple folders without any input required from the user. This can be particularly useful in ML applications when requiring training images for image classifiers when the data set you have is insufficient for good learning.
